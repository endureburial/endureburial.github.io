                We met at a diner on the route to Vegas. I got her a black coffee and slice of apple pie. We were both travelling alone, both runnin’ away from something or other. Her daddy liked to drink n’, as you can imagine, she often ended up on his bad side. She had dreams of open roads and neon signs and a new town every weekend where no one knew who she was. That’s the thing about this country: the roads never end and the signs always call to you. You could spend your whole damned life on a never-ending highway and find friendship at every truck stop. And that’s how we met. I was in some trouble with the law but I kept that fact to myself at the time. They say stuff like that catches up with you: they must’ve never met a guy like me!
            </p>
            <p2>
                Well anyway, she was the most beautiful thing I ever saw. She had those big sad eyes that make your heart melt like butter in the midday sun and thighs that were sculpted by God himself. I could talk about the way she cracked up like a little kid when I did that goofy dance on the hood of the car, or the way she got all quiet when she saw drifters on the sidewalk that looked a little bit like her old man, but I never much saw the point of reliving the past. I try to keep my head clear and walk on through this desert here but it’s hard not to fall into the temptation of thinkin’ about her. I’ve been walking for so long I must be right in the middle of the desert by now. Sometimes I catch a glimpse of her in the mirage, a faint vision of her beautiful big eyes all blurry from the heat. The sun stopped setting a while ago. It’s like the day wants to keep on walkin’ with me! The night doesn’t come anymore n’ it’s just like a book where the chapter never ends.

                If you ask me, I reckon I like being alone. Sure, some company would be nice but I never was the type to keep anyone close. When someone leaves they don’t just come right back. And so I keep on walking. I got lost a while back but I figure I lost so much it might as well be my turn to <i>get</i> lost. Don’t worry about me now, I’ll get to where I’m goin’ eventually. For now, I’ll keep on walking.
