            <p>
                How did it come to this? There you were, in that Pizza Express on Harborne High Street with your wife and two kids. It was a Friday evening and you hadn’t changed from your work clothes. As you were walking from the carpark to the restaurant, a young man heckled you. He cupped his mouth with both hands and shouted “Frasier Crane!” across the street. His friends chuckled and gesturally congratulated him for the good joke. You were dwelling on this incident as you stared at the cutlery. Your family were sitting in the dull silence that occurs when everyone involved wishes they were elsewhere. At some point the food arrives. The chopping board topped with Fiorentina pizza appears in front of you without you noticing. Your wife’s ravioli is halfway diminished before you see it.
            </p>
            <p2>    
                Oh, how did it come to this? As you reach for the pizza cutter, your raised arm catches the end of the chopping board that was resting precariously off the edge of the table. The board flips toward you and the pizza slides into your lap. Your beige suit is ruined. The yolk of the fried egg drips down from your crotch; the tomato sauce taunts you with every splash inflicted on your grey shirt. Despair! Despair strikes your core. None of your family reacts. You study their faces, one by one. Your wife looks the other way, refusing to acknowledge what has happened. From her profile you sense pure disdain, dark disgust behind her eyes. You know this expression intimately. Your daughter looks back you. She is too embarrassed to react. Without wanting to draw any more attention to you she stays silent and averts her gaze. Your son is still eating.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You scoop the pizza back onto the board and find your way to the water closet. You rest both hands on the sink and lean towards your reflection. You are glad that your beige suit is ruined. You are glad that your family doesn’t love you. Tomorrow you will leave them all. You won’t say goodbye. You won’t even pack. But why wait until tomorrow? You shall go right this moment, relinquish all ties to this agonising existence and greet the morning as a free man. But something doesn’t feel quite right. Your reflection starts to blur and your head pounds. Your legs feel weak and buckle under the weight of your body. Your efforts to lift yourself up from the ground are futile. Your heart slows and your lungs collapse. You are lying on the floor in the foetal position thinking, <q>How did it come to this?</q> And yet, this is it.
